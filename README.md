# MobileNet V1 Implementation from scratch

This repository contains the implementation of a MobileNet model from scratch to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is the Cats vs. Dogs dataset from TensorFlow Datasets.

## Repository Structure

- `model.py`: Defines the MobileNet model architecture.
- `train.py`: Handles training and evaluation of the model.
- `test.py`: Loads an image, preprocesses it, and uses the trained model to make predictions.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions such as image preprocessing.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the training and testing.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
